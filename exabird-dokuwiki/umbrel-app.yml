description: '[Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki/) is a simple to use and
  highly versatile Open Source wiki software that doesn''t require a database. It
  is loved by users for its clean and readable syntax. The ease of maintenance, backup
  and integration makes it an administrator''s favorite. Built in access controls
  and authentication connectors make DokuWiki especially useful in the enterprise
  context and the large number of plugins contributed by its vibrant community allow
  for a broad range of use cases beyond a traditional wiki.'
