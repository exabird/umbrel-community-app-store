name: quassel-core
description: Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core - much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical. Blowfish support and optional web-ui included.
