description: "[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is the world\u2019s foremost\
  \ and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what\u2019s happening\
  \ on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure)\
  \ standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies,\
  \ and educational institutions. Wireshark development thrives thanks to the volunteer\
  \ contributions of networking experts around the globe and is the continuation of\
  \ a project started by Gerald Combs in 1998."
