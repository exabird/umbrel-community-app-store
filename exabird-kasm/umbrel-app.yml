  Workspaces is a docker container streaming platform for delivering browser-based
  access to desktops, applications, and web services. Kasm uses devops-enabled Containerized
  Desktop Infrastructure (CDI) to create on-demand, disposable, docker containers
  that are accessible via web browser. Example use-cases include Remote Browser Isolation
  (RBI), Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Desktop as a Service (DaaS), Secure Remote Access
  Services (RAS), and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) collections. The rendering
  of the graphical-based containers is powered by the open-source project [KasmVNC](https://www.kasmweb.com/kasmvnc.html?utm_campaign=LinuxServer&utm_source=kasmvnc).'
