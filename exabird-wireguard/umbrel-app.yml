description: "[WireGuard\xAE](https://www.wireguard.com/) is an extremely simple yet\
  \ fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be\
  \ faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive\
  \ headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard\
  \ is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super\
  \ computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for\
  \ the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android)\
  \ and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it\
  \ might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution\
  \ in the industry."
