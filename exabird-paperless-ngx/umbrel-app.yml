description: 'Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical
  documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, less paper.  Paperless-ngx
  forked from paperless-ng to continue the great work and distribute responsibility
  of supporting and advancing the project among a team of people. Consider joining
  us! Discussion of this transition can be found in issues #1599 and #1632.  A demo
  is available at demo.paperless-ngx.com using login demo / demo. Note: demo content
  is reset frequently and confidential information should not be uploaded.'
