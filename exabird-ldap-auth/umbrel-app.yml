description: "[Ldap-auth](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-ldap-auth) software is\
  \ for authenticating users who request protected resources from servers proxied\
  \ by nginx. It includes a daemon (ldap-auth) that communicates with an authentication\
  \ server, and a webserver daemon that generates an authentication cookie based on\
  \ the user\u2019s credentials. The daemons are written in Python for use with a\
  \ Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication server (OpenLDAP or\
  \ Microsoft Windows Active Directory 2003 and 2012)."
