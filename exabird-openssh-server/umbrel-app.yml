description: '[Openssh-server](https://www.openssh.com/) is a sandboxed environment
  that allows ssh access without giving keys to the entire server. Giving ssh access
  via private key often means giving full access to the server. This container creates
  a limited and sandboxed environment that others can ssh into. The users only have
  access to the folders mapped and the processes running inside this container.'
