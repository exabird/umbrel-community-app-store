description: '[Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/) is a distributed computing
  project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding
  and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together
  citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their
  personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand
  biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics.'
