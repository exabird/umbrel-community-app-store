description: '[WebCord](https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord) can be summarized
  as a pack of security and privacy hardenings, Discord features reimplementations,
  Electron / Chromium / Discord bugs workarounds, stylesheets, internal pages and
  wrapped https://discord.com page, designed to conform with ToS as much as it is
  possible (or hide the changes that might violate it from Discord''s eyes).'
