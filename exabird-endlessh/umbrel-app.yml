description: '[Endlessh](https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh) is an SSH tarpit that
  very slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner. It keeps SSH clients locked up
  for hours or even days at a time. The purpose is to put your real SSH server on
  another port and then let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit instead of
  bothering a real server.'
