description: '[Papermerge](https://www.papermerge.com/) is an open source document
  management system (DMS) primarily designed for archiving and retrieving your digital
  documents. Instead of having piles of paper documents all over your desk, office
  or drawers - you can quickly scan them and configure your scanner to directly upload
  to Papermerge DMS.'''
